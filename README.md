# Repository for *Which plant traits increase soil carbon sequestration? Empirical evidence from a long-term poplar genetic diversity trial* published in *Global Change Biology*
This repository contains all data and code needed to create the manuscript. The analysis combined several soil and root data sets collected by researchers at the Clatskanie Poplar Common Garden in Clatskanie, OR by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) researchers from 2019-2024. The data harmonization codes are located in the */01-codes/01-harmonize-clatskanie-data-pub.qmd* file while the analysis and figure generation for the manuscript are located in the */01-codes/01-gcb-pub-analysis.qmd* file. These *Quarto* notebooks use *R* language to perform all calculations.
