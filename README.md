A. (2025). Which plant traits increase soil carbon sequestration? Empirical evidence from a long-term poplar genetic diversity trial (p. 2025.02.17.638464). bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.17.638464

Our analysis combined several soil and root data sets collected by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) researchers/collaborators from the Clatskanie Poplar Common Garden in Clatskanie, OR by from 2009-2024. The data harmonization codes are located in the */01-codes/01-harmonize-clatskanie-data-pub.qmd* file while the analysis and figure generation for the manuscript are located in the */01-codes/01-gcb-pub-analysis.qmd* file. These *Quarto* notebooks have corresponding rendered PDFs in the same location. *R* version 4.4.1 was used for all analysis.
